# Blocks are synced when promoting learner node <nodeName> in network <networkName>

* Promote learner node <nodeName> from node "Node1", in the network <networkName>
* Send some transactions to create blocks in network <networkName> and capture the latest block height as "latestBlockHeight"
* Verify node <nodeName> has the block height greater or equal to "latestBlockHeight"
