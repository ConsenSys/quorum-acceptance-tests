This spec covers testing the following:
deploy smart contract
call methods
check if events are emitted in all nodes


## test private smart contract from a default account in node1 with private for node2. verify events are present only in node 1 & 2
* private smart contract from node "1" to node "2" with "1" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node2 with private for node3. verify events are present only in node 2 & 3
* private smart contract from node "2" to node "3" with "2" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node3 with private for node4. verify events are present only in node 3 & 4
* private smart contract from node "3" to node "4" with "3" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node4 with private for node5. verify events are present only in node 4 & 5
* private smart contract from node "4" to node "5" with "4" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node5 with private for node6. verify events are present only in node 5 & 6
* private smart contract from node "5" to node "6" with "5" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node6 with private for node7. verify events are present only in node 6 & 7
* private smart contract from node "6" to node "7" with "6" events

## test private smart contract from a default account in node7 with private for node1. verify events are present only in node 7 & 1
